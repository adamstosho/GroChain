# JWT Settings Update

## Problem
The authentication system was experiencing issues where users would be logged out after refreshing the page or after a short period of time. This was caused by:

1. **Short JWT expiration**: Access tokens were expiring after only 1 hour
2. **Missing automatic refresh**: No automatic token refresh mechanism
3. **Cookie expiration mismatch**: Frontend expected 24-hour cookies but backend set 1-hour tokens

## Solution
Updated the JWT configuration to provide a better user experience:

### New JWT Settings
```typescript
// Before (problematic)
JWT_EXPIRES_IN: '1h'           // 1 hour - too short
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES_IN: '7d'   // 7 days

// After (improved)
JWT_EXPIRES_IN: '24h'          // 24 hours - reasonable
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES_IN: '30d'  // 30 days - extended
```

### Frontend Improvements
1. **Automatic token refresh**: Tokens are refreshed 5 minutes before expiration
2. **Better error handling**: Improved authentication state management
3. **AuthGuard component**: Better protection of routes with proper loading states
4. **Cookie synchronization**: Frontend and backend cookies now match

### Backend Improvements
1. **Extended token lifetime**: 24 hours instead of 1 hour
2. **Better cookie handling**: Consistent cookie expiration times
3. **Improved refresh logic**: More robust token refresh mechanism

## Environment Variables
Make sure your `.env` file includes these updated values:

```bash
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=24h
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES_IN=30d
```

## Benefits
- Users stay logged in for 24 hours instead of 1 hour
- Automatic token refresh prevents session expiration
- Better user experience with fewer login prompts
- Consistent authentication state across page refreshes
- Reduced authentication errors and redirects

## Testing
After updating the settings:
1. Restart your backend server
2. Clear browser cookies and localStorage
3. Log in again
4. Test page refresh - should maintain authentication
5. Wait for automatic token refresh (check console logs)

## Notes
- The system now automatically refreshes tokens 5 minutes before expiration
- Refresh tokens last for 30 days, providing long-term authentication
- All protected routes now use the AuthGuard component for consistent protection
