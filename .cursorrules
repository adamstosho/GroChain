# Next.js TypeScript Frontend Rules
- Use App Router structure with `page.tsx` per route.
- Kebab-case directories, PascalCase component files.
- Prefer named exports.
- Default to React Server Components; use client only when needed.
- Use strict TypeScript (no `any`), meaningful variable names.
- Place components in `/components`, API utilities in `/lib`, types in `/types`.
